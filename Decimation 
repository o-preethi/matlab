%% Decimation Example in MATLAB

% Original signal
Fs = 1000;                   % Original sampling frequency (Hz)
t = 0:1/Fs:1;                % Time vector (1 second)
x = sin(2*pi*50*t) + 0.5*sin(2*pi*200*t);  % Composite signal (50 Hz + 200 Hz)

% Decimation factor
M = 4;                       % Downsample by factor of 4

%% Method 1: Manual Decimation (Low-pass Filter + Downsample)

% Step 1: Low-pass filter to remove high-frequency content
